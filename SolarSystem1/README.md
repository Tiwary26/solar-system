3D Solar System Simulation

A 3D interactive Solar System simulation built using Three.js.
This project visualizes planets orbiting around the sun with realistic animations and controls.

🚀 Features

🪐 Orbital animation of planets around the Sun

🌍 Scaled sizes of planets & distances (simplified for visualization)

🎛️ Speed controls to adjust orbiting speed

🌙 Optional features:

Tooltips with planet information

Dark mode toggle

Camera zoom and rotation

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML, JavaScript

Three.js (for 3D rendering)
